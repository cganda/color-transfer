# Color Transfer Program
Takes two input images and creates a new image. Uses the shape of one image and the colors of the other image.
Basically, transfers the colors of one image to another.

Examples
![example 1](examples/example1.jpg)
![example 1](examples/example2.jpg)
![example 1](examples/example3.jpg)
![example 1](examples/example4.jpg)
![example 1](examples/example5.jpg)
![example 1](examples/example6.jpg)
![example 1](examples/example7.jpg)
![example 1](examples/example8.jpg)
![example 1](examples/example9.jpg)

When opened, two file dialogs will appear, one for the shape image and one for the color image. The images will be displayed on the program window on the left and right. The result will be displayed in the middle of the window and will be saved to the data directory of the project.

This was created with [Processing](https://processing.org/), a java-base environment for visual applications

Use small images to prevent out of memory errors.
Some image combinations may have errors. The result image is not created or displayed.
